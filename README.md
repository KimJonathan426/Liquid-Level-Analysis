# Liquid-Level-Analysis

This program was created to experiment with the machine learning capabilities of assessing liquid levels. The program uses a sequential machine learning model via keras and tensorflow. It utilizes an open source computer vision and machine learning software called OpenCV coupled with a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and Raspberry Pi camera module to access and analyze video. 

This project represents a proof of concept that with more improvement and tuning could accurately define sufficiency levels in patient blood samples. With further improvements, this could be able to detect sufficiency even under the influence of obstructions such as bubbles, foreign objects, and other unforeseen factors.
